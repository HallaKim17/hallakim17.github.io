  <p> Press 'play' button below to hear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_Occupants_of_Interplanetary_Craft">'Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft'</a> by Klaatu.! This song, one of my favorites, was inspired by actual event which attepmted to send a telepathic message into space. So, in order to visualize the inspiration of this song, I made amplitude and frequency spectrum to denote the Earth people's message and alien life's saying each.By adding simple symbols to audio visualization, I hope this would help imagine the concepts of the song and fully enjoy the music.</p>

  <p>Respond to the saying of occupants of interplanetary craft. The frequency spectrum is matched to calling of extraterrestrial, and the moon above to our(the Earth's) response. Say anything you want, then they'll hear you. You can sing along the lyrics or just say any words. Enjoy!"</p>
